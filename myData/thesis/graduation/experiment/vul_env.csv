,CVE-2023-21839,NETWORK,system cia loss,"Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server product of Oracle Fusion Middleware (component: Core).  Supported versions that are affected are 12.2.1.3.0, 12.2.1.4.0 and  14.1.1.0.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via T3, IIOP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server.  Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle WebLogic Server accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.5 (Confidentiality impacts).  CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)."
,CVE-2018-15473,NETWORK,system cia loss,"OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c."
webserver,CVE-2020-9402,NETWORK,system cia loss,"Django 1.11 before 1.11.29, 2.2 before 2.2.11, and 3.0 before 3.0.4 allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a tolerance parameter in GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle. By passing a suitably crafted tolerance to GIS functions and aggregates on Oracle, it was possible to break escaping and inject malicious SQL."
webserver,CVE-2016-9086,NETWORK,system cia loss,"GitLab versions 8.9.x and above contain a critical security flaw in the ""import/export project"" feature of GitLab. Added in GitLab 8.9, this feature allows a user to export and then re-import their projects as tape archive files (tar). All GitLab versions prior to 8.13.0 restricted this feature to administrators only. Starting with version 8.13.0 this feature was made available to all users. This feature did not properly check for symbolic links in user-provided archives and therefore it was possible for an authenticated user to retrieve the contents of any file accessible to the GitLab service account. This included sensitive files such as those that contain secret tokens used by the GitLab service to authenticate users. GitLab CE and EE versions 8.13.0 through 8.13.2, 8.12.0 through 8.12.7, 8.11.0 through 8.11.10, 8.10.0 through 8.10.12, and 8.9.0 through 8.9.11 are affected."
webserver,CVE-2017-8386,NETWORK,gain user privilege,"git-shell in git before 2.4.12, 2.5.x before 2.5.6, 2.6.x before 2.6.7, 2.7.x before 2.7.5, 2.8.x before 2.8.5, 2.9.x before 2.9.4, 2.10.x before 2.10.3, 2.11.x before 2.11.2, and 2.12.x before 2.12.3 might allow remote authenticated users to gain privileges via a repository name that starts with a - (dash) character."
gateway,CVE-2020-13945,NETWORK,system cia loss,"In Apache APISIX, the user enabled the Admin API and deleted the Admin API access IP restriction rules. Eventually, the default token is allowed to access APISIX management data. This affects versions 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5."


,CVE-2017-5223,LOCAL,system cia loss,"An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory."
,CVE-2021-34371,NETWORK,gain user privilege,"Neo4j through 3.4.18 (with the shell server enabled) exposes an RMI service that arbitrarily deserializes Java objects, e.g., through setSessionVariable. An attacker can abuse this for remote code execution because there are dependencies with exploitable gadget chains."


,CVE-2018-2894,NETWORK,gain user privilege,"Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS - Web Services). Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.3.0, 12.2.1.2 and 12.2.1.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle WebLogic Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Oracle WebLogic Server. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.8 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)."
,CVE-2016-5734,NETWORK,gain user privilege,"phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 does not properly choose delimiters to prevent use of the preg_replace e (aka eval) modifier, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted string, as demonstrated by the table search-and-replace implementation."
,CVE-2018-17246,NETWORK,gain user privilege,Kibana versions before 6.4.3 and 5.6.13 contain an arbitrary file inclusion flaw in the Console plugin. An attacker with access to the Kibana Console API could send a request that will attempt to execute javascript code. This could possibly lead to an attacker executing arbitrary commands with permissions of the Kibana process on the host system.
,CVE-2017-1000353,NETWORK,gain user privilege,"Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're fixing this issue by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're also backporting the new HTTP CLI protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS 2.46.2, and deprecating the remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization) CLI protocol, disabling it by default."

,CVE-2017-17405,NETWORK,gain root privilege,"Ruby before 2.4.3 allows Net::FTP command injection. Net::FTP#get, getbinaryfile, gettextfile, put, putbinaryfile, and puttextfile use Kernel#open to open a local file. If the localfile argument starts with the ""|"" pipe character, the command following the pipe character is executed. The default value of localfile is File.basename(remotefile), so malicious FTP servers could cause arbitrary command execution."
,CVE-2020-7247,NETWORK,gain root privilege,"smtp_mailaddr in smtp_session.c in OpenSMTPD 6.6, as used in OpenBSD 6.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root via a crafted SMTP session, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters in a MAIL FROM field. This affects the ""uncommented"" default configuration. The issue exists because of an incorrect return value upon failure of input validation."
,CVE-2021-4034,LOCAL,gain root privilege,A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.
