7|0|1|3|6|9 , Attackers can access the CGE account management function without privilege for permission elevation and execute arbitrary commands or files after obtaining user permissions.
10|7|0|6|9 , Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.

7|0|6 , The AjaxControl component of Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal 10.3.3 does not validate the names of pages when processing page rename requests. Pages can be renamed to include characters unsupported for URIs by the web server hosting the WCI Portal software (such as IIS). Renaming pages to include unsupported characters, such as 0x7f, prevents these pages from being accessed over the web server, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to the page. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.
7|4|0|6 , An issue was discovered in CommentsService.ashx in OnyakTech Comments Pro 3.8. An attacker can download a copy of the installer, decompile it, and discover a hardcoded IV used to encrypt the username and userid in the comment POST request. Additionally, the attacker can decrypt the encrypted encryption key (sent as a parameter in the comment form request) by setting this encrypted value as the username, which will appear on the comment page in its decrypted form. Using these two values (combined with the encryption functionality discovered in the decompiled installer), the attacker can encrypt another user's ID and username. These values can be used as part of the comment posting request in order to spoof the user.
5 , A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE W780 and W740 (IEEE 802.11n) family (All versions < V6.3).

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks.
10|7|0|6|9 , An issue was discovered in certain Apple products. iOS before 11.2.5 is affected. macOS before 10.13.3 is affected. tvOS before 11.2.5 is affected. watchOS before 4.2.2 is affected. The issue involves the "Kernel" component. It allows attackers to bypass intended memory-read restrictions via a crafted app.
7|0|6 , The transferFrom function of a smart contract implementation for FuturXE (FXE), an Ethereum ERC20 token, allows attackers to accomplish an unauthorized transfer of digital assets because of a logic error. The developer messed up with the boolean judgment - if the input value is smaller than or equal to allowed value, the transfer session would stop execution by returning false. This makes no sense, because the transferFrom() function should require the transferring value to not exceed the allowed value in the first place. Suppose this function asks for the allowed value to be smaller than the input. Then, the attacker could easily ignore the allowance: after this condition, the `allowed[from][msg.sender] -= value;` would cause an underflow because the allowed part is smaller than the value. The attacker could transfer any amount of FuturXe tokens of any accounts to an appointed account (the `_to` address) because the allowed value is initialized to 0, and the attacker could bypass this restriction even without the victim's private key.
7|0|6 , OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version 4.0.3, There is a vulnerability that enabled pre-auth server side template injection via Bean validation message tampering.

7|0|6 , A vulnerability allows a phreaking attack on HCL legacy IVR systems that do not use VoIP. These IVR systems rely on various frequencies of audio signals; based on the frequency, certain commands and functions are processed. Since these frequencies are accepted within a phone call, an attacker can record these frequencies and use them for service activations. This is a request-forgery issue when the required series of DTMF signals for a service activation is predictable (e.g., the IVR system does not speak a nonce to the caller). In this case, the IVR system accepts an activation request from a less-secure channel (any loudspeaker in the caller's physical environment) without verifying that the request was intended (it matches a nonce sent over a more-secure channel to the caller's earpiece).
7|0|6 , syslogd in the syslog subsystem in Apple iOS before 8 and Apple TV before 7 allows local users to change the permissions of arbitrary files via a symlink attack on an unspecified file.

10|7|0|6|9 , GitLab versions 8.9.x and above contain a critical security flaw in the "import/export project" feature of GitLab. Added in GitLab 8.9, this feature allows a user to export and then re-import their projects as tape archive files (tar). All GitLab versions prior to 8.13.0 restricted this feature to administrators only. Starting with version 8.13.0 this feature was made available to all users. This feature did not properly check for symbolic links in user-provided archives and therefore it was possible for an authenticated user to retrieve the contents of any file accessible to the GitLab service account. This included sensitive files such as those that contain secret tokens used by the GitLab service to authenticate users. GitLab CE and EE versions 8.13.0 through 8.13.2, 8.12.0 through 8.12.7, 8.11.0 through 8.11.10, 8.10.0 through 8.10.12, and 8.9.0 through 8.9.11 are affected.

The fstream.DirWriter() function is vulnerable.
10|7|0|6|9 , Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.1.0.0.5.394 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A local malicious user with high privileges may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.
5 , A service worker can send the activate event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually, allowing it to monitor activity by users. Affects all versions prior to Firefox 60.
7|0|6 , An issue was discovered in the Widgets extension through 1.4.0 for MediaWiki. Improper title sanitization allowed for the execution of any wiki page as a widget (as defined by this extension) via MediaWiki's {{#widget:}} parser function.
7|6|0 , The software attempts to access a file based on the filename, but it does not properly prevent that filename from identifying a link or shortcut that resolves to an unintended resource.
5 , The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects.			  While the product might limit the amount of memory that is allocated in a single operation for a single object (such as a malloc of an array), if an attacker can cause multiple objects to be allocated in separate operations, then this might cause higher total memory consumption than the developer intended, leading to a denial of service.
10 , During installation, installed file permissions are set to allow anyone to modify those files.
0 , The product uses a denylist-based protection mechanism to defend against XSS attacks, but the denylist is incomplete, allowing XSS variants to succeed.While XSS might seem simple to prevent, web browsers vary so widely in how they parse web pages, that a denylist cannot keep track of all the variations. The "XSS Cheat Sheet" [REF-714] contains a large number of attacks that are intended to bypass incomplete denylists.
7|6|0 , The software assigns the wrong ownership, or does not properly verify the ownership, of an object or resource.
4|9|7|0|6|3 , The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.
4 , The product released to market is released in pre-production or manufacturing configuration.				Products in the pre-production or manufacturing stages are configured to have many debug hooks and debug capabilities, including but not limited to:								Ability to override/bypass various cryptographic checks (including authentication, authorization, and integrity)				Ability to read/write/modify/dump internal state (including registers and memory)				Ability to change system configurations				Ability to run hidden or private commands that are not allowed during production (as they expose IP).				The above is by no means an exhaustive list, but it alludes to the greater capability and the greater state of vulnerability of a product during it's preproduction or manufacturing state.				Complexity increases when multiple parties are involved in executing the tests before the final production version. For example, a chipmaker might fabricate a chip and run its own preproduction tests, following which the chip would be delivered to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), who would now run a second set of different preproduction tests on the same chip. Only after both of these sets of activities are complete, can the overall manufacturing phase be called “complete” and have the “Manufacturing Complete” fuse blown. However, if the OEM forgets to blow the Manufacturing Complete fuse, then the system remains in the manufacturing stage, rendering the system both exposed and vulnerable.
4|9|7|0|6|3 , The product does not require that users should have strong passwords, which makes it easier for attackers to compromise user accounts.Authentication mechanisms often rely on a memorized secret (also known as a password) to provide an assertion of identity for a user of a system. It is therefore important that this password be of sufficient complexity and impractical for an adversary to guess. The specific requirements around how complex a password needs to be depends on the type of system being protected. Selecting the correct password requirements and enforcing them through implementation are critical to the overall success of the authentication mechanism.
4|7|6|0 , The credentials necessary for unlocking a device are shared across multiple parties and may expose sensitive information.				“Unlocking a device” often means activating certain, unadvertised, debug and manufacturer-specific capabilities of a device using sensitive credentials. Unlocking a device might be necessary for the purpose of troubleshooting device problems. For example, suppose a device contains the ability to dump the content of the full system memory by disabling the memory-protection mechanisms. Since this is a highly security-sensitive capability, this capability is “locked” in the production part. Unless the device gets unlocked by supplying the proper credentials the debug capabilities are not available. For cases where the chip designer, chip manufacturer (fabricator), and manufacturing and assembly testers are the all employed by the same company, the compromise of the credentials are greatly reduced. However, when the chip designer is employed by one company, the chip manufacturer is employed by another company (a foundry), and the assemblers and testers are employed by yet a third company. Since these different companies will need to perform various tests on the device to verify correct device function, they all need to share the unlock key. Unfortunately, the level of secrecy and policy might be quite different at each company, greatly increasing the risk of sensitive credentials being compromised.
0 , The software validates input before it is canonicalized, which prevents the software from detecting data that becomes invalid after the canonicalization step.This can be used by an attacker to bypass the validation and launch attacks that expose weaknesses that would otherwise be prevented, such as injection.
10|3 , The software does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.
9|0 , The software does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.
0 , The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes output that is written to logs.            This can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into logs.            Log forging vulnerabilities occur when:                                             Data enters an application from an untrusted source.                  The data is written to an application or system log file.
