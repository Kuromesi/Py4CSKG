75 , An issue was discovered on D-Link DCS-1130 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of setting a SMB folder for the video clippings recorded by the device. It seems that the POST parameters passed in this request (to test if email credentials and hostname sent to the device work properly) result in being passed as commands to a "system" API in the function and thus result in command injection on the device. If the firmware version is dissected using binwalk tool, we obtain a cramfs-root archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that contains all the binaries. The library "libmailutils.so" is the one that has the vulnerable function "sub_1FC4" that receives the values sent by the POST request. If we open this binary in IDA-pro we will notice that this follows an ARM little endian format. The function sub_1FC4 in IDA pro is identified to be receiving the values sent in the POST request and the value set in POST parameter "receiver1" is extracted in function "sub_15AC" which is then passed to the vulnerable system API call. The vulnerable library function is accessed in "cgibox" binary at address 0x00023BCC which calls the "Send_mail" function in "libmailutils.so" binary as shown below which results in the vulnerable POST parameter being passed to the library which results in the command injection issue.

221 , issues with partially successful P2M updates on x86 T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guests may be started in populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a way for them to later easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to control certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specified via page orders (resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). In some cases the hypervisor carries out the requests by splitting them into smaller chunks. Error handling in certain PoD cases has been insufficient in that in particular partial success of some operations was not properly accounted for. There are two code paths affected - page removal (CVE-2021-28705) and insertion of new pages (CVE-2021-28709). (We provide one patch which combines the fix to both issues.)

154 , The VStarCam vstc.vscam.client library and vstc.vscam shared object, as used in the Eye4 application (for Android, iOS, and Windows), do not prevent spoofing of the camera server. An attacker can create a fake camera server that listens for the client looking for a camera on the local network. When the camera responds to the client, it responds via the broadcast address, giving all information necessary to impersonate the camera. The attacker then floods the client with responses, causing the original camera to be denied service from the client, and thus causing the client to then communicate exclusively with the attacker's fake camera server. When connecting to the fake camera server, the client sends all details necessary to login to the camera (username and password).
52 , test/tc_database.rb in the lean-ruport gem 0.3.8 for Ruby places the mysql user password on the mysqldump command line, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by listing the process.

153 , An issue was discovered in the Bluetooth component of the Cypress (formerly owned by Broadcom) Wireless IoT codebase. Extended Inquiry Responses (EIRs) are improperly handled, which causes a heap-based buffer overflow during device inquiry. This overflow can be used to overwrite existing functions with arbitrary code. The Reserved for Future Use (RFU) bits are not discarded by eir_handleRx(), and are included in an EIR's length. Therefore, one can exceed the expected 240 bytes, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in eir_getReceivedEIR() called by bthci_event_SendInquiryResultEvent(). In order to exploit this bug, an attacker must repeatedly connect to the victim's device in a short amount of time from different source addresses. This will cause the victim's Bluetooth stack to resolve the device names and therefore allocate buffers with attacker-controlled data. Due to the heap corruption, the name will be eventually written to an attacker-controlled location, leading to a write-what-where condition.

162 , pacman before 5.1.3 allows directory traversal when installing a remote package via a specified URL "pacman -U <url>" due to an unsanitized file name received from a Content-Disposition header. pacman renames the downloaded package file to match the name given in this header. However, pacman did not sanitize this name, which may contain slashes, before calling rename(). A malicious server (or a network MitM if downloading over HTTP) can send a Content-Disposition header to make pacman place the file anywhere in the filesystem, potentially leading to arbitrary root code execution. Notably, this bypasses pacman's package signature checking. This occurs in curl_download_internal in lib/libalpm/dload.c.
5 , IBM Business Process Manager (aka BPM) 7.5.x, 8.0.x, and 8.5.x and WebSphere Lombardi Edition (aka WLE) 7.2.x allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions on internal service types via vectors involving the executeServiceByName URL.

119 , Command injection vulnerability in change password of QNAP Q'center Virtual Appliance version 1.7.1063 and earlier could allow authenticated users to run arbitrary commands.
183 , The fetch API in Tightrope Media Carousel before 7.1.3 has CarouselAPI/v0/fetch?url= SSRF. This has two potential areas for abuse. First, a specially crafted URL could be used in a phishing attack to hijack the trust the user and the browser have with the website and could serve malicious content from a third-party attacker-controlled system. Second, arguably more severe, is the potential for an attacker to circumvent firewall controls, by proxying traffic, unauthenticated, into the internal network from the internet.
25 , ** DISPUTED ** TinyXML2 6.2.0 has a heap-based buffer over-read in the XMLDocument::Parse function in libtinyxml2.so. NOTE: The tinyxml2 developers have determined that the reported overflow is due to improper use of the library and not a vulnerability in tinyxml2.

5 , cPanel before 11.54.0.0 allows unauthorized zone modification via the WHM API (SEC-66).
244 , D-Link DAP-1860 devices before v1.04b03 Beta allow access to administrator functions without authentication via the HNAP_AUTH header timestamp value. In HTTP requests, part of the HNAP_AUTH header is the timestamp used to determine the time when the user sent the request. If this value is equal to the value stored in the device's /var/hnap/timestamp file, the request will pass the HNAP_AUTH check function.
13 , SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in MapCal 0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the id parameter in an editevent action, possibly related to dsp_editevent.php.
52 , Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\Doctrine\QueryCollectionExtension\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.
129 , The Telecom Component in Android 5.0.x before 5.0.2, 5.1.x before 5.1.1, and 6.x before 2016-04-01 allows attackers to spoof the originating telephone number of a call via a crafted application, as demonstrated by obtaining Signature or SignatureOrSystem access, aka internal bug 26864502.
129 , Zomplog 3.8.1 and earlier stores potentially sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download files that were uploaded by users, as demonstrated by obtaining a directory listing via a direct request to /upload and then retrieving individual files.  NOTE: in a non-default configuration, the directory listing is denied, but filenames may be predicable.
168 , D-Bus 1.4.x through 1.6.x before 1.6.30, 1.8.x before 1.8.16, and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not validate the source of ActivationFailure signals, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (activation failure error returned) by leveraging a race condition involving sending an ActivationFailure signal before systemd responds.
15 , In Backdrop CMS 1.12.x before 1.12.8 and 1.13.x before 1.13.3, some menu links within the administration bar may be crafted to execute JavaScript when the administrator is logged in and uses the search functionality. (This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permissions to create administrative menu links, such as by creating a content type or layout. Such permissions are usually restricted to trusted or administrative users.)
50 , ** DISPUTED ** Technicolor TC7200.20 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (networking outage) via a flood of random MAC addresses, as demonstrated by macof. NOTE: Technicolor denies that the described behavior is a vulnerability and states that Wi-Fi traffic is slowed or stopped only while the devices are exposed to a MAC flooding attack. This has been confirmed through testing against official up-to-date versions.
75 , git-fastclone before 1.0.1 permits arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules. If an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive clone from a repository they control, they can get a client to run an arbitrary shell command. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted git clone, they could exploit this. The ext command will be run if the repository is recursively cloned or if submodules are updated. This attack works when cloning both local and remote repositories.
162 , rtcmulticonnection-client is a signaling implementation for RTCMultiConnection.js, a multi-session manager. rtcmulticonnection-client is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue, giving an attacker access to the filesystem by placing "../" in the url.
154 , KDE KAuth before 5.55 allows the passing of parameters with arbitrary types to helpers running as root over DBus via DBusHelperProxy.cpp. Certain types can cause crashes, and trigger the decoding of arbitrary images with dynamically loaded plugins. In other words, KAuth unintentionally causes this plugin code to run as root, which increases the severity of any possible exploitation of a plugin vulnerability.
153 , A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.2), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.2). The Tiff_loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing TIFF files.

154 , xorg-x11-server before 1.19.5 was missing length validation in X-Resource extension allowing malicious X client to cause X server to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.
15 , A Reflected Authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Newsletter plugin before 6.8.2 for WordPress allows remote attackers to trick a victim into submitting a tnpc_render AJAX request containing either JavaScript in an options parameter, or a base64-encoded JSON string containing JavaScript in the encoded_options parameter.
244 , The Festo CECX-X-C1 Modular Master Controller with CoDeSys and CECX-X-M1 Modular Controller with CoDeSys and SoftMotion do not require authentication for connections to certain TCP ports, which allows remote attackers to (1) modify the configuration via a request to the debug service on port 4000 or (2) delete log entries via a request to the log service on port 4001.
119 , AppUse 4.0 allows shell command injection via a proxy field.
154 , Securifi Almond devices with firmware before AL1-R201EXP10-L304-W34 and Almond-2015 devices with firmware before AL2-R088M unintentionally omit the X-Frame-Options HTTP header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site that contains a (1) FRAME, (2) IFRAME, or (3) OBJECT element.
52 , The XSSAuditor::init function in core/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp in the XSS auditor in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117, processes POST requests by using the body of a redirecting page instead of the body of a redirect target, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.
43 , In the flush_tmregs_to_thread function in arch/powerpc/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.5, a guest kernel crash can be triggered from unprivileged userspace during a core dump on a POWER host due to a missing processor feature check and an erroneous use of transactional memory (TM) instructions in the core dump path, leading to a denial of service.
285 , OneDev is a development operations platform. If the LDAP external authentication mechanism is enabled in OneDev versions 4.4.1 and prior, an attacker can manipulate a user search filter to send forged queries to the application and explore the LDAP tree using Blind LDAP Injection techniques. The specific payload depends on how the User Search Filter property is configured in OneDev. This issue was fixed in version 4.4.2.

75|153 , Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides an HTTP web server exposing a management interface that can be used to configure the access point. Two versions of this management interface exists: one based on Go-Ahead named webs and another based on Boa named boa. Both of them are affected by these vulnerabilities. Specifically, these binaries are vulnerable to the following issues: - stack buffer overflow in formRebootCheck due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlanMultipleAP due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlSiteSurvey due to unsafe copy of ifname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formStaticDHCP due to unsafe copy of hostname parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of 'peerPin' parameter - arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd via the sysCmd parameter - arbitrary command injection in formWsc via the 'peerPin' parameter Exploitability of identified issues will differ based on what the end vendor/manufacturer did with the Realtek SDK webserver. Some vendors use it as-is, others add their own authentication implementation, some kept all the features from the server, some remove some of them, some inserted their own set of features. However, given that Realtek SDK implementation is full of insecure calls and that developers tends to re-use those examples in their custom code, any binary based on Realtek SDK webserver will probably contains its own set of issues on top of the Realtek ones (if kept). Successful exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the device.

129 , OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.1.3 and Havana before havana-2 does not properly enforce the os-flavor-access:is_public property, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information (flavor properties), boot arbitrary flavors, and possibly have other unspecified impacts by guessing the flavor id.
154 , The (1) EC2 and (2) OS APIs in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2), Essex (2012.1), and Diablo (2011.3) do not properly check the protocol when security groups are created and the network protocol is not specified entirely in lowercase, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
236 , mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In versions prior to 2.4.9, `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` does not parse URLs the same way as most browsers do. As a result, this function can be bypassed and leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout functionality. This bug has been fixed in version 2.4.9 by replacing any backslash of the URL to redirect with slashes to address a particular breaking change between the different specifications (RFC2396 / RFC3986 and WHATWG). As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow redirection whose destination matches a given regular expression.
154 , In ImageMagick 7.0.6-5, a length-validation vulnerability was found in the function ReadPSDLayersInternal in coders/psd.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (ReadPSDImage memory exhaustion) via a crafted file.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting malicious values for a specific ROMMON variable. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code and bypass the image verification check during the secure boot process of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have unauthenticated, physical access to the device or obtain privileged access to the root shell on the device.
288 , Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. In Wasmtime from version 0.19.0 and before version 0.30.0 there was a use-after-free bug when passing `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm content. To trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple `externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same time, either by passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm function, or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-value return function defined in the host. If you do not have host code that matches one of these shapes, then you are not impacted. If Wasmtime's `VMExternRefActivationsTable` became filled to capacity after passing the first `externref` in, then passing in the second `externref` could trigger a garbage collection. However the first `externref` is not rooted until we pass control to Wasm, and therefore could be reclaimed by the collector if nothing else was holding a reference to it or otherwise keeping it alive. Then, when control was passed to Wasm after the garbage collection, Wasm could use the first `externref`, which at this point has already been freed. We have reason to believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because usage of `externref` is currently quite rare. The bug has been fixed, and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime yet, you can avoid the bug by disabling reference types support in Wasmtime by passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`.

178 , Moodle through 2.5.2 allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary programs by configuring the aspell pathname and then triggering a spell-check operation within the TinyMCE editor.
28 , Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.4.13, there exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse. If one has a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header, then sending a request with a certain Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request is sent. In this case, the backend does not see the request header. A patch is available in version 2.4.13. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
13 , SourceCodester Online Clothing Store 1.0 is affected by a SQL Injection via the txtUserName parameter to login.php.

119 , An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing attackers to gain host OS privileges via DMA in a situation where an untrusted domain has access to a physical device. This occurs because passed through PCI devices may corrupt host memory after deassignment. When a PCI device is assigned to an untrusted domain, it is possible for that domain to program the device to DMA to an arbitrary address. The IOMMU is used to protect the host from malicious DMA by making sure that the device addresses can only target memory assigned to the guest. However, when the guest domain is torn down, or the device is deassigned, the device is assigned back to dom0, thus allowing any in-flight DMA to potentially target critical host data. An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation. Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable.
75 , This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DVA-2800 and DSL-2888A routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the dhttpd service, which listens on TCP port 8008 by default.

172 , Zulip is an open source group chat application that combines real-time chat with threaded conversations. In affected versions expiration dates on the confirmation objects associated with email invitations were not enforced properly in the new account registration flow. A confirmation link takes a user to the check_prereg_key_and_redirect endpoint, before getting redirected to POST to /accounts/register/. The problem was that validation was happening in the check_prereg_key_and_redirect part and not in /accounts/register/ - meaning that one could submit an expired confirmation key and be able to register. The issue is fixed in Zulip 4.8. There are no known workarounds and users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
138 , A privileged account with a weak default password on the Foxconn femtocell FEMTO AP-FC4064-T version AP_GT_B38_5.8.3lb15-W47 LTE Build 15 can be used to turn on the TELNET service via the web interface, which allows root login without any password.

By continuously executing the failed login attempts, UI management of the device becomes impossible.
72 , BlogEngine.NET 3.3 allows XXE attacks via the POST body to metaweblog.axd.
178 , Norton Remove & Reinstall can be susceptible to a DLL preloading vulnerability. These types of issues occur when an application looks to call a DLL for execution and an attacker provides a malicious DLL to use instead. Depending on how the application is configured, it will generally follow a specific search path to locate the DLL. The vulnerability can be exploited by a simple file write (or potentially an over-write) which results in a foreign DLL running under the context of the application. A Norton Remove & Reinstall update, version 4.4.0.58, has been released which addresses the aforementioned vulnerability.

Android ID: A-33139050.
52 , The CFNetwork HTTPProtocol component in Apple iOS before 9 and OS X before 10.11 does not properly recognize the HSTS preload list during a Safari private-browsing session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.
72 , Aruba Airwave all versions up to, but not including, 8.2.3.1 is vulnerable to an XML external entities (XXE). XXEs are a way to permit XML parsers to access storage that exist on external systems. If an unprivileged user is permitted to control the contents of XML files, XXE can be used as an attack vector. Because the XML parser has access to the local filesystem and runs with the permissions of the web server, it can access any file that is readable by the web server and copy it to an external system of the attacker's choosing. This could include files that contain passwords, which could then lead to privilege escalation.
13 , SQL injection vulnerability in the Yet Another Calendar (ke_yac) extension before 1.1.2 for TYPO3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.

128 , In Drupal 8.x prior to 8.3.7 When creating a view, you can optionally use Ajax to update the displayed data via filter parameters. The views subsystem/module did not restrict access to the Ajax endpoint to only views configured to use Ajax. This is mitigated if you have access restrictions on the view. It is best practice to always include some form of access restrictions on all views, even if you are using another module to display them.
113 , An issue was discovered in AppArmor before 2.12. Incorrect handling of unknown AppArmor profiles in AppArmor init scripts, upstart jobs, and/or systemd unit files allows an attacker to possibly have increased attack surfaces of processes that were intended to be confined by AppArmor. This is due to the common logic to handle 'restart' operations removing AppArmor profiles that aren't found in the typical filesystem locations, such as /etc/apparmor.d/. Userspace projects that manage their own AppArmor profiles in atypical directories, such as what's done by LXD and Docker, are affected by this flaw in the AppArmor init script logic.
101 , The ESET AV parsing engine allows virus-detection bypass via a crafted BZ2 Checksum field in an archive. This affects versions before 1294 of Smart Security Premium, Internet Security, NOD32 Antivirus, Cyber Security Pro (macOS), Cyber Security (macOS), Mobile Security for Android, Smart TV Security, and NOD32 Antivirus 4 for Linux Desktop.

13 , Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Web-Dorado ECommerce WD (com_ecommercewd) component 1.2.5 for Joomla! allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) search_category_id, (2) sort_order, or (3) filter_manufacturer_ids in a displayproducts action to index.php.
154|265 , cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a given point when the input data is string data rather than type `number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library). Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0 has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a `TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or `number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its `f(x)` function, respectively.
43 , Adobe Acrobat Reader versions 15.020.20042 and earlier, 15.006.30244 and earlier, 11.0.18 and earlier have an exploitable memory corruption vulnerability when processing tags in TIFF images. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

52 , An undisclosed vulnerability in CLM applications may result in some administrative deployment parameters being shown to an attacker.
162 , The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\extraction\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

The system_server process in the core Android package has an exported broadcast receiver that allows any app co-located on the device to programmatically initiate the taking of a screenshot and have the resulting screenshot be written to external storage. The taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user; the device has a screen animation as the screenshot is taken and there is a notification indicating that a screenshot occurred. If the attacking app also requests the EXPAND_STATUS_BAR permission, it can wake the device up using certain techniques and expand the status bar to take a screenshot of the user's notifications even if the device has an active screen lock. The notifications may contain sensitive data such as text messages used in two-factor authentication. The system_server process that provides this capability cannot be disabled, as it is part of the Android framework. The notification can be removed by a local Denial of Service (DoS) attack to reboot the device.

The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.
163 , An issue was discovered on Teracue ENC-400 devices with firmware 2.56 and below. After successful authentication, the device sends an authentication cookie to the end user such that they can access the devices web administration panel. This token is hard-coded to a string in the source code (/usr/share/www/check.lp file). By setting this cookie in a browser, an attacker is able to maintain access to every ENC-400 device without knowing the password, which results in authentication bypass. Even if a user changes the password on the device, this token is static and unchanged.
21 , IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6 Work Centers' application does not validate file type upon upload, allowing attackers to upload malicious files. IBM X-Force ID: 156565.
153 , A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06.

57 , Terminology before 1.3.1 allows Remote Code Execution because popmedia is mishandled, as demonstrated by an unsafe "cat README.md" command when \e}pn is used. A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of executable file formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types (/usr/share/applications). The control sequence defers unknown file types to the handle_unknown_media() function, which executes xdg-open against the filename specified in the sequence. The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control sequence through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When the control sequence is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file will be run.

158 , In Gradle from version 5.1 and before version 7.0 there is a vulnerability which can lead to information disclosure and/or dependency poisoning. Repository content filtering is a security control Gradle introduced to help users specify what repositories are used to resolve specific dependencies. This feature was introduced in the wake of the "A Confusing Dependency" blog post. In some cases, Gradle may ignore content filters and search all repositories for dependencies. This only occurs when repository content filtering is used from within a `pluginManagement` block in a settings file. This may change how dependencies are resolved for Gradle plugins and build scripts. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks: 1) Information disclosure: Gradle could make dependency requests to repositories outside your organization and leak internal package identifiers. 2) Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For a full example and more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. The problem has been patched and released with Gradle 7.0. Users relying on this feature should upgrade their build as soon as possible. As a workaround, users may use a company repository which has the right rules for fetching packages from public repositories, or use project level repository content filtering, inside `buildscript.repositories`. This option is available since Gradle 5.1 when the feature was introduced.

69 , Enterprise Access Client Auto-Updater allows for Remote Code Execution prior to version 2.0.1.
45 , An issue was discovered in Navigate CMS 2.9 r1433. When performing a password reset, a user is emailed an activation code that allows them to reset their password. There is, however, a flaw when no activation code is supplied. The system will allow an unauthorized user to continue setting a password, even though no activation code was supplied, setting the password for the most recently created user in the system (the user with the highest user id).
235 , cmus-status-display in cmus 2.2.0 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the /tmp/cmus-status temporary file.
43 , The Microsoft (1) VBScript 5.7 and 5.8 and (2) JScript 5.7 and 5.8 engines, as used in Internet Explorer 8 through 11 and other products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site, aka "Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
43 , The sg_build_indirect function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in Linux kernel 2.6.28-rc1 through 2.6.31-rc8 uses an incorrect variable when accessing an array, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS and NULL pointer dereference), as demonstrated by using xcdroast to duplicate a CD.  NOTE: this is only exploitable by users who can open the cdrom device.
50 , A Denial of Service (DoS) condition is possible in OpenStack Mistral in versions up to and including 7.0.3. Submitting a specially crafted workflow definition YAML file containing nested anchors can lead to resource exhaustion culminating in a denial of service.

232 , The default configuration of the Security global settings on the Citrix NetScaler Access Gateway appliance with Enterprise Edition firmware 9.0, 8.1, and earlier specifies Allow for the Default Authorization Action option, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions.
52 , MediaWiki before 1.27.4, 1.28.x before 1.28.3, and 1.29.x before 1.29.2, when a private wiki is configured, provides different error messages for failed login attempts depending on whether the username exists, which allows remote attackers to enumerate account names and conduct brute-force attacks via a series of requests.
15 , A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the web application of Pydio through 8.2.2 that can be exploited by levering the file upload and file preview features of the application. An authenticated attacker can upload an HTML file containing JavaScript code and afterwards a file preview URL can be used to access the uploaded file. If a malicious user shares an uploaded HTML file containing JavaScript code with another user of the application, and tricks an authenticated victim into accessing a URL that results in the HTML code being interpreted by the web browser, then the included JavaScript code is executed under the context of the victim user session.
236 , IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.6.0 and 7.6.1 could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using a tabnabbing attack. By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim. IBM X-Force ID: 179537.
43 , Buffer overflow in Huawei Mate8 NXT-AL before NXT-AL10C00B182, NXT-CL before NXT-CL00C92B182, NXT-DL before NXT-DL00C17B182, and NXT-TL before NXT-TL00C01B182 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted app.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-1923.
15 , Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Kayako SupportSuite 3.20.02 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the sessionid parameter in a livesupport startclientchat action to visitor/index.php; (2) the filter parameter in a news view action to index.php; or the Full Name field in a (3) account creation, (4) ticket opening, or (5) chat request operation.
113 , ZoneAlarm Firewall and Antivirus products before version 15.8.109.18436 allow an attacker who already has access to the system to execute code at elevated privileges through a combination of file permission manipulation and exploitation of Windows CVE-2020-00896 on unpatched systems.
129 , The Forward module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.21 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.3 for Drupal does not properly enforce permissions for (1) Recent forwards, (2) Most forwarded, or (3) Dynamic blocks, which allows remote attackers to obtain node titles via unspecified vectors.
29 , Memory leak in the unshare_userns function in kernel/user_namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.10.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via an invalid CLONE_NEWUSER unshare call.
171|25 , In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases, loading a saved model can result in accessing uninitialized memory while building the computation graph. The MakeEdge function creates an edge between one output tensor of the src node (given by output_index) and the input slot of the dst node (given by input_index). This is only possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the function begins by obtaining the corresponding DataType values and comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.
25 , The chk_mem_access function in cpu/nes6502/nes6502.c in libnosefart.a in Nosefart 2.9-mls allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory read and application crash) via a crafted nsf file.
247 , An issue was discovered on Samsung mobile devices with Q(10.0) (Exynos990 chipsets) software. The S3K250AF Secure Element CC EAL 5+ chip allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and obtain sensitive information via a buffer overflow. The Samsung ID is SVE-2020-18632 (November 2020).
69 , Jenkins Codefresh Integration Plugin 1.8 and earlier disables SSL/TLS and hostname verification globally for the Jenkins master JVM.
154 , In Apache Struts 2.5 through 2.5.5, if an application allows entering a URL in a form field and the built-in URLValidator is used, it is possible to prepare a special URL which will be used to overload server process when performing validation of the URL.
52 , Cisco Unified MeetingPlace 8.6(1.2) does not properly validate session IDs in http URLs, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive session information via a crafted URL, aka Bug ID CSCuu60338.
61 , Git Plugin connects to a user-specified Git repository as part of form validation. An attacker with no direct access to Jenkins but able to guess at a username/password credentials ID could trick a developer with job configuration permissions into following a link with a maliciously crafted Jenkins URL which would result in the Jenkins Git client sending the username and password to an attacker-controlled server.
15 , Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in module/search/function.php in Ganesha Digital Library (GDL) 4.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the keyword parameter in a ByEge action.

15 , Akaunting version 2.1.12 and earlier suffers from a persistent (type II) cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the sales invoice processing component of the application. This issue was fixed in version 2.1.13 of the product.
235 , A flaw was found in RPC request using gfs3_symlink_req in glusterfs server which allows symlink destinations to point to file paths outside of the gluster volume. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to create arbitrary symlinks pointing anywhere on the server and execute arbitrary code on glusterfs server nodes.
5|232 , The ASUS WL-330NUL router has a configuration process that relies on accessing the 192.168.1.1 IP address, but the documentation advises users to instead access a DNS hostname that does not always resolve to 192.168.1.1, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack the configuration traffic by controlling the server associated with that hostname.
195 , A Java Serialization vulnerability was found in Apache Tapestry 4. Apache Tapestry 4 will attempt to deserialize the "sp" parameter even before invoking the page's validate method, leading to deserialization without authentication. Apache Tapestry 4 reached end of life in 2008 and no update to address this issue will be released. Apache Tapestry 5 versions are not vulnerable to this issue. Users of Apache Tapestry 4 should upgrade to the latest Apache Tapestry 5 version.

72 , The _clone function in XML::LibXML before 2.0119 does not properly set the expand_entities option, which allows remote attackers to conduct XML external entity (XXE) attacks via crafted XML data to the (1) new or (2) load_xml function.
52 , The Microsoft Server Block Message (SMB) on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10 Gold, 1511, 1607, and 1703, and Windows Server 2016, allows an information disclosure vulnerability in the way that it handles certain requests, aka "Windows SMB Information Disclosure Vulnerability".
15 , Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cybozu Office 9.0.0 through 10.3.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-7795, CVE-2015-7796, CVE-2015-7797, CVE-2015-7798, and CVE-2016-1149.
43 , Heap-based buffer overflow in the AppleTalk networking stack in XNU 1228.3.13 and earlier on Apple Mac OS X 10.5.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a ZIP NOTIFY (aka ZIPOP_NOTIFY) packet that overwrites a certain ifPort structure member.
129 , On Windows endpoints, the SecureConnector agent must run under the local SYSTEM account or another administrator account in order to enable full functionality of the agent. The typical configuration is for the agent to run as a Windows service under the local SYSTEM account. The SecureConnector agent runs various plugin scripts and executables on the endpoint in order to gather and report information about the host to the CounterACT management appliance. The SecureConnector agent downloads these scripts and executables as needed from the CounterACT management appliance and runs them on the endpoint. By default, these executable files are downloaded to and run from the %TEMP% directory of the currently logged on user, despite the fact that the SecureConnector agent is running as SYSTEM. Aside from the downloaded scripts, the SecureConnector agent runs a batch file with SYSTEM privileges from the temp directory of the currently logged on user. If the naming convention of this script can be derived, which is made possible by placing it in a directory to which the user has read access, it may be possible overwrite the legitimate batch file with a malicious one before SecureConnector executes it. It is possible to change this directory by setting the the configuration property config.script_run_folder.value in the local.properties configuration file on the CounterACT management appliance, however the batch file which is run does not follow this property.
52 , Mail in Apple iOS before 10 mishandles certificates, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to discover mail credentials via unspecified vectors.
61 , The Uninstall REST endpoint in Atlassian Universal Plugin Manager before version 2.22.19, from version 3.0.0 before version 3.0.3 and from version 4.0.0 before version 4.0.3 allows remote attackers to uninstall plugins using a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on an authenticated administrator.

29 , EOSDataServer.exe in C3-ilex EOScada before 11.0.19.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a large amount of data to TCP port 24006.
3 , A vulnerability in Cisco Packet Tracer for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL injection attack on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting a configuration file in a specific path on the system, which can cause a malicious DLL file to be loaded when the application starts. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with normal user privileges to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of another user&rsquo;s account.
245|137 , In ParseMetaGeometry() of MagickCore/geometry.c, image height and width calculations can lead to divide-by-zero conditions which also lead to undefined behavior. This flaw can be triggered by a crafted input file processed by ImageMagick and could impact application availability. The patch uses multiplication in addition to the function `PerceptibleReciprocal()` in order to prevent such divide-by-zero conditions. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.
43 , All versions of VAMPSET software produced by Schneider Electric, prior to V2.2.189, are susceptible to a memory corruption vulnerability when a corrupted vf2 file is used. This vulnerability causes the software to halt or not start when trying to open the corrupted file. This vulnerability occurs when fill settings are intentionally malformed and is opened in a standalone state, without connection to a protection relay. This attack is not considered to be remotely exploitable. This vulnerability has no effect on the operation of the protection relay to which VAMPSET is connected.

154 , Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 SP3, 1.1 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2, 3.5 SP1, 3.5.1, and 4 does not properly serialize input data, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted XAML browser application (aka XBAP) or (2) a crafted .NET Framework application, aka ".NET Framework Serialization Vulnerability."
13|276 , rConfig 3.9.4 and previous versions has unauthenticated devices.inc.php SQL injection. Because, by default, nodes' passwords are stored in cleartext, this vulnerability leads to lateral movement, granting an attacker access to monitored network devices.
29 , The GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) inspection engine in Cisco ASA Software 8.2 before 8.2(5.51), 8.4 before 8.4(7.15), 8.7 before 8.7(1.13), 9.0 before 9.0(4.8), and 9.1 before 9.1(5.1) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) via a crafted series of GTP packets, aka Bug ID CSCum56399.
15 , The SEO Redirection Plugin â€“ 301 Redirect Manager WordPress plugin before 6.4 did not sanitise the Redirect From and Redirect To fields when creating a new redirect in the dashboard, allowing high privilege users (even with the unfiltered_html disabled) to set XSS payloads
235 , NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.12.0, and NLnet Labs NSD, up to and including version 4.3.3, contain a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID file, Unbound and NSD create the file if it is not there, or open an existing file for writing. In case the file was already present, they would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink instead of a regular file. An additional chown of the file would then take place after it was written, making the user Unbound/NSD is supposed to run as the new owner of the file. If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound/NSD runs as, she could create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that she would like to erase. If then Unbound/NSD is killed and the PID file is not cleared, upon restarting with root privileges, Unbound/NSD will rewrite any file pointed at by the symlink. This is a local vulnerability that could create a Denial of Service of the system Unbound/NSD is running on. It requires an attacker having access to the limited permission user Unbound/NSD runs as and point through the symlink to a critical file on the system.
178 , In Gxlcms QY v1.0.0713, the update function in Lib\Lib\Action\Admin\TplAction.class.php allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by placing this code into a template.
29 , The packet-storing feature on Cisco 9900 phones with firmware 9.3(2) does not properly support the RTP protocol, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device hang) by sending malformed RTP packets after a call is answered, aka Bug ID CSCur39976.
75 , Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by command injection by an authenticated user. This affects XR450 before 2.3.2.114, XR500 before 2.3.2.114, and WNR2000v5 before 1.0.0.76.

52 , Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private information on a participant's screen, even though the participant never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user shares a specific application window via the Share Screen functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus. (An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data, this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe security issue.
119 , TP-Link WDR Series devices through firmware v3 (such as TL-WDR5620 V3.0) are affected by command injection (after login) leading to remote code execution, because shell metacharacters can be included in the weather get_weather_observe citycode field.
43 , Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.232 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.508 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.199, Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.199, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.199 allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-5545, CVE-2015-5546, CVE-2015-5547, CVE-2015-5548, CVE-2015-5549, CVE-2015-5552, and CVE-2015-5553.
129 , Windows NT Task Scheduler installed with Internet Explorer 5 allows a user to gain privileges by modifying the job after it has been scheduled.
15 , In MyBB before 1.8.11, the Email MyCode component allows XSS, as demonstrated by an onmouseover event.

The affected versions are before version 8.19.1.
128 , The AliasHandler component in PostfixAdmin before 3.0.2 allows remote authenticated domain admins to delete protected aliases via the delete parameter to delete.php, involving a missing permission check.
15 , Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in admin.php in the Shareaholic plugin before 7.6.1.0 for WordPress allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the location[id] parameter in a shareaholic_add_location action to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php.
129 , The pfs_getextattr function in FreeBSD 7.x before 7.3-RELEASE and 8.x before 8.0-RC1 unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic), overwrite arbitrary memory locations, and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to opening a file on a file system that uses pseudofs.
154 , A Remote Code Execution vulnerability in HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT version PLAT 7.3 (E0504) was found. The problem was resolved in HPE Intelligent Management Center PLAT v7.3 (E0506) or any subsequent version.
83 , The Momo application 2.1.9 for Android stores confidential information insecurely on the system (i.e., in cleartext), which allows a non-root user to find out the username/password of a valid user and a user's access token via Logcat.
113 , An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing 32-bit PV guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges by installing and using descriptors. There is missing descriptor table limit checking in x86 PV emulation. When emulating certain PV guest operations, descriptor table accesses are performed by the emulating code. Such accesses should respect the guest specified limits, unless otherwise guaranteed to fail in such a case. Without this, emulation of 32-bit guest user mode calls through call gates would allow guest user mode to install and then use descriptors of their choice, as long as the guest kernel did not itself install an LDT. (Most OSes don't install any LDT by default). 32-bit PV guest user mode can elevate its privileges to that of the guest kernel. Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only 32-bit PV guest user mode can leverage this vulnerability. HVM, PVH, as well as 64-bit PV guests cannot leverage this vulnerability. Arm systems are unaffected.
43 , Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and 10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted web site, aka "Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-3201, CVE-2013-3203, CVE-2013-3207, and CVE-2013-3209.

213 , containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim’s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the "host" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless of what container runtime is used for running that container.
43 , VMware Workstation (12.x prior to 12.5.3) and Horizon View Client (4.x prior to 4.4.0) contain a heap buffer-overflow vulnerability in TrueType Font (TTF) parser in the TPView.dll.

153 , Acrobat Reader DC versions versions 2020.013.20074 (and earlier), 2020.001.30018 (and earlier) and 2017.011.30188 (and earlier) are affected by an Out-of-bounds Write vulnerability when parsing a crafted jpeg file. An unauthenticated attacker could leverage this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.
235 , Race condition in the jas_stream_tmpfile function in libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (program exit) by creating the appropriate tmp.XXXXXXXXXX temporary file, which causes Jasper to exit.  NOTE: this was originally reported as a symlink issue, but this was incorrect.  NOTE: some vendors dispute the severity of this issue, but it satisfies CVE's requirements for inclusion.
43 , Adobe Flash Player versions 29.0.0.113 and earlier have an exploitable Heap Overflow vulnerability. Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure.
126 , The FreeCell Solitaire (aka com.mobilityware.freecell) application 2.1.2 for Android does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
178 , The DS\NDSD component in Novell eDirectory 8.8 before SP5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed bind LDAP packet.
288|153 , Use after free in audio in Google Chrome prior to 84.0.4147.125 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.
43 , Buffer overflow in the NTLMSSP dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed packet.
193 , Integer overflow in the JPEGImageReader implementation in the ImageI/O component in Sun Java SE in JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 22, JDK and JRE 6 before Update 17, and SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2_24 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via large subsample dimensions in a JPEG file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, aka Bug Id 6874643.
154 , The arch_dup_task_struct function in the Transactional Memory (TM) implementation in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.7 on the powerpc platform does not properly interact with the clone and fork system calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (Program Check and system crash) via certain instructions that are executed with the processor in the Transactional state.
147 , A service worker can send the activate event on itself periodically which allows it to run perpetually, allowing it to monitor activity by users. Affects all versions prior to Firefox 60.
129 , Open-Xchange Server before 6.20.7 rev14, 6.22.0 before rev13, and 6.22.1 before rev14 uses weak permissions (group "other" readable) under opt/open-xchange/etc/, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via standard filesystem operations.
29 , A vulnerability exists during authorization prompting for FTP transaction where successive modal prompts are displayed and cannot be immediately dismissed. This allows for a denial of service (DOS) attack. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 66.
